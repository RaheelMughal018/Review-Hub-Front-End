"Thanks for the Amiga acknowledgement. The 1980's era computer history stories often overlook that the most innovative and forward thinking technology of the time was found in the Amiga. Sadly, winning the game wasn't a matter of who manufactured the best computer and OS, but came down to who could manufacture the best marketing hype (and Jobs was a master of marketroid hype, especially when hyping himself). in example: When Atlanta was making it's bid for the '96 Olympics,  Georgia Tech created an elaborate, state of the art, multi screen, multi-projector, multi media promotional presentation run from multiple synchronized random access videodisc players with multiple synchronized digital audio channels for multiple translations. All of those elements were controlled by a single Amiga2500. The video screens were arranged in a semi-circle around a translucent 3D relief model of Atlanta which was backlit by simple still graphics from a Mac to highlight the venue locations featured in the videos. Again, a single Amiga2500, with it's multi processor design and multi tasking, priority preemptive operating system controlled and synchronized every device and every element of the multimedia extravaganza, including telling the dumb terminal Mac which still graphic to display. The sophisticated presentation reportedly played a big role in Atlanta hosting the 1996 Olympics. Now guess which computer system got ZERO mention in the press and which was portrayed as the brains of the setup??",Neutral,2

I’m not a big fan of either headset tbh but mark is delusional if he doesn’t see that Apple is blowing them out of the water when it comes to the productivity aspect of the meta quest that they pushed so hard in the past few years. No one uses a quest for work because it inhibits you far more than it provides any tangible benefit, Apple has done a good job at making working between Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc as seamless as it could be for a gen 1 device. It is a walled garden approach but if you’re a part of that ecosystem it is a much better experience.

And often if I’m just at my desk or laying down watching a movie, I have it plugged in so batter life isn’t an issue.

Neural interface is EEG (like Muse Band). Nothing invasive.,Neutral,2
If Zuck wants to make the Quest open he should allow developer access to the camera stream. So many opportunities here.,Neutral,2

Neural Interface? Are we chippin' in?,Question,4
Did you mistake dynamic range for field of view?,Question,4
""" limited Dynamic range, like you are looking through binoculars""  does not make sense. Binoculars do not change contrast, HDR, dynamic range, they might reduce field of view (FOV) though. Looking through the digital image finder in a camera might be an analogy for reduced dynamic range.",Neutral,2
alright! where did that photo of Steve jobs and Bill gates right by each other SMILING come from?,Question,4

"Meta isn't the open model, though, Valve is. So many different headsets, peripherals, and applications run and are interoperable through the SteamVR runtime. Meta, in comparison, is locked to its headsets and app store (unless you link to PC and run on SteamVR anyways)",Neutral,2

"Though VR is in its infancy with debatable games, graphics, and overall choice! - What I can say is the fact that the adult entertainment companies are completely smashing the technology including their ability to slowly change just how it is now viewed.

"Not much of a Zuck fan, but he made sense at the end of that clip. I never liked iPhones because the closed and locked-down model felt like a huge step back compared to the old Palm Tungsten devices I was using before, where I could upload programs via USB cable or Bluetooth, or even write programs on the device with PocketC or LispMe back in like... 2006.
Yeah Apple's model means lower likelihood of accidentally installing spyware on the device, but Android's permissions model has gotten pretty good at protecting users (but not perfect). That said, I think calling Meta an open model is a bit of a stretch -- it's not completely trivial to install stuff outside of the Quest store, it's very hard to get stuff into the store (compared to e.g. Android or even iOS), but Sidequest is pretty impressive, and you can run your own programs on it without having to pay Apple $100.",Neutral,2

Of course this particular incarnation of the VR/AR glasses won't take off right up, I predict that if they can come up with a killer App, they might get a few niches, but still my prediction is that, those glasses will only go mainstream after they live in a form factor no bigger than your wayfarer sunglasses and with r many hours battery life, before we go full on over neural interfaces, the next better thing will be extremely low power lasers drawing the image straight into your retina.",Recommendation,3

"I'm still on the first OnePlus watch and find it pretty good for the price at the moment I bought it. 
Snappy, light, battery life is excellent (12 / 20d in battery mode) and it makes everything I need a smartwatch to do : give me the moment of the day, buzz with notifications, track my sleep & fitnesses and count my steps ! 

Don't think i'm switching to the second one but hey, maybe in a few years !",Neutral,2
Hey Marques! Can you make a video on the Samsung Fit 3? I'd like to know whether it would be a better choice over a smartwatch if I'm solely focusing on the fitness tracking.,Recommendation,3
Hello. I wanted to know which watch you show at the end that you say is for fitness? thank you. greetings,Question,4

"I have the original oneplus watch and I think it's interesting that it beats this one in some aspects, like battery life. I don't have optimizations for it and it lasts me a solid 6 to 8 days, and notifications are also a lot better, I flip the watch and it shows them instantly. Kinda weird how they didn't tranfer those over",Neutral,2

This will be the 3rd OP product I've owned. My first was the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition, coming from the Note 5 and I loved it. Since there wasn't going to be anymore android support for the OP 7T's, I leveled up to the OP 11 5G...and I love that phone just as much... Now we'll see how this OP Watch 2 holds up.... So far, I've been really impressed with OP products!!!",Positive,0

"Currently have a TicWatch Pro 5 which has started to remind me every 5 minutes that it's having ""sync"" issues with the Mobvoi Health app, and refuses to let me fix it. Given I can return it, get this with some cool looking wireless earbuds AND have change, it's a no brainer. It sounds like this is a ridiculous step up over that one too as it will never look ""cheap"" which was the only mild gripe I had with the TicWatch's battery saving technique of having an LCD display over the OLED.",Negative,1
"Great looking watch at a great price.  Shame is is slightly larger than Big Ben in London.  It would be helpful if they made watches for people that werent larger than a grandfather clock.  Great battery life, perhaps most of the mass of the watch is Lithium Ion?!!  Love the twin processors.  I would buy tomorrow if I was big enough to wear it.

The twin OS concept is very similar to Infotainment in cars. Safety critical things like chimes and reverse cameras work on RTOS whereas Android does all the other heavy lifting,Question,4
What watch face are you using at 9:10? It looks really cool.,Question,4
"Fun fact: Infotainment systems in cars also typically have two separate processors, one fo high end features, the other rtos one for simpler tasks and is always ON -- and it in fact wakes up the high end one when needed.",Positive,0
I guess WearOS or WatchOS may have built-in RTOS style low power mode in future. That would eliminate the need of a separate processor in the watch. It can just work with the existing high-efficiency cores of the main processor.,Negative,1

Still aching for a nice analogue watch with the basic smart health functions built in and a basic complication for notifications (to then detail on your phone) I have a few analogue watches I love the look of - much much moreso than a boring smart watch which is just a soulless black disc on my wrist - but with analogue I immediately start missing all the functions of a smart watch.,Positive,0

"I recently switched to a OnePlus 12 phone and I love it, and as much as I was looking forward for their watch 2 to get, the two deal breakers for me to  buy this watch are: 1. One reviewer mentioned that OnePlus will only support the software for 2 years, and 2. There's no LTE version. As a long distance runner who doesn't carry a phone with him, having a means of communication is very important to me, and I was doing that with my Apple watch and now with my Samsung 6 classic.

Wanted to let you know to check out Huawei's watches. Don't know how easy they are to get for you now, hence the Huawei is on a lot of blacklists. Anyway, I have the Huawei Watch GT (launched in 2019), have had this one since it launched and it's really impressive. Usually I have a week of battery life on it, but in some cases it could last almost 2 weeks - And this with the pulse reading always active. Keep in mind this is already 5 years old, but it only came with 420mAh battery. Still some off the software is kinda ""dum"", and also, you don't get a lot of apps or options to add apps. Even with all these cons, it's not as slow as the OnePlus, and I would happily wait for a new watch that is better in all other terms as long as it could match Huawei's battery life",Recommendation,3

"To be more specific - A hybrid is a combination of the WORSE of both world. It's not an appropriate comparison to an electronic device with two extra chips and bit of software.

- Two different systems with all of their components crammed in every possible corner.
- Additional moving parts adding to mechanical losses and complexity.
- Additional maintenance AND more expensive.
- Much shorter service life. Optimized to work during the warranty period... no more.
- Small capacity NiMH battery with short life loosing charge-discharge cycles daily.
- No power and NO real fuel savings. Start-stop situation might see some improvements, but nothing meaningful. (toyota were sued for false advertising up to 6 times higher fuel consumption than advertised. Paid to silence the news)
- NO emissions reduction. Actually even greater footprint. (toyota were sued for hiding emission documentation for their hybrids for decades. Paid to silence the news... again)

"An LLM is by definition not AGI. They're completely different things. LLMs work from pattern recognition heuristics in text, which means they can never understand what they're writing. It's like the Chinese Room argument. It will make an attempt to simulate text that makes a logical argument, but it does not itself make a logical argument. You may ask what the point of that distinction is if the LLM can do it well enough that we can't see any issues with it, but the problem is that that just means we cease to be able to guide it. It will never surpass humanity's collective intelligence via text prediction.
We already have lots of programs that can perform logical deduction and some that can perform a limited amount of logical induction. The only way in which they are not strictly superior to an LLM is in their inability to parse the parameters to work within when given in plain English. Actually, an LLM might be able to fill that gap and make those kinds of programs easier to use and easier to develop. But they're not going to be themselves the thing that becomes AGI, it's just that they might unlock our potential to actually develop AGI.

While prefill aren't really a thing for GPT, you can still get vastly more power over it with system prompts.

Of course, I may be a bit ignorant here as I'm not subscribed to any of these LLMs, but I've used their 'free' variants. Which I know doesn't give you the ability to do custom define prompt setups, so chatGPT+ and Anthropic Subscriber's users may have a different experience here.

Apex male figure
Alpha male exemplar
Quintessential alpha
Pinnacle of male authority
Chief among alpha males

Time to drop GPT and switch to Claude,Recommendation,3
"I was playing around with it a bit and was surprised at how well it handles politically contentious topics. It definitely uses some politically correct language and rides the fence and gives both sides. But it doesn't just give the mainstream acceptable points and then pretend all arguments against that are istaphobic. I would give examples of what it said to me, but the best ones I got out of it, while factually true, would likely get this comment deleted lol. Think crime statistics or IQ trends

It also seems way more transparent about how it avoids offensive answers and stuff than the others. It could be lying or wrong about that, but all the responses I got seemed to fit with what it said.

"Your AI voice sounds more natural and sonorous than your natural voice. Weird. Maybe it's a small-sample thing. However, your content is good so all is well.",Positive,0
Your AI voice is less good of an AI voice than your normal voice which makes people think that your AI voice was always an AI voice and your real AI voice is your AI voice with clutter so if it is AI or not AI I wouldn't know since your normal AI voice is not an AI voice. I think I am stuck in an infinite loop.,Positive,0

"Soo we software-engineers, programmers and developers are finally being replaced?",Question,4
"i get that AI content pays your bills, but Im sure what you meant to say in the beginning of the video, is that we're sick of you comparaing ALLL other AGIs to ChatGPT, kind of like theyre already the standard( I pay to use them because of no fluff like just performance tests that really dont reveal anything especially how shit they are on an individual  use basis).",Negative,1
I am disturbed by the imagery. Deeply disturbed.,Negative,1
"Judging by the insane difference between Sora and everything else out there, it's a safer bet to just stick with OpenAI's API's and wait for their upcoming Q* or GPT5 whatever it's called.

"Citizen saved my life!  Was swimming and diving in to a river.  I come up from the bottom and climbed out to dive in again and was covered in blood, pouring out from my wrist and forearm.  Had hit a broken bottle.  The strap on the Citizen watch has a big gouge out of it right about where the main veins run.  If I had not been wearing the watch that day I believe I would have been in serious trouble as no doubt the veins would have been torn to shreds!  So Citizen watches have a place in my heart since that day.  Was very lucky!",Negative,1

I definitely wouldn't have handled it with the grace you did, my immediate thought would have been ""I'm paying for the space the same as you are, I'll do whatever I want in my studio."" Especially after their condescending tone calling you a nuisance.

Bravo for handling that with such class. Absolute legend man.",Positive,0
"Hello, Nico! 

My father’s was a watch collector, and because of him i start loving watches! 

After he past away about two years ago, i sold all my watches. 

After i start watching your channel about 1 month ago my passion for watches came back and i start once again my collection. 

Thank you for that! Cheers!",Positive,0
Videos like this are more needed. I am new to the watch game and not rich enough to be blowing over £500 on a watch yet. The Timex Q Chronograph was the gateway into watches for me last year. I now have that and a Casio MTP-1302PD-2A2VEF... Love your videos and one day I will work my way up to some dream watches!,Positive,0
"Funny in all my watches the one I get the most eyeballs on is my Casio. Its a MTP1302D-2A2V (Tiffany Casio) and even a few folks have said ""Is that a rolex"" lol. But most just say ""Hey nice watch"" . Love the everyday sub $200 watch that I can wear and not be afraid to scratch or damage.",Positive,0
"Thank you Nico for making the watch world a better place. I am currently wearing a Garmin, which I love for heart rate and steps. I got a lot of Casios i wear sometimes. Videos like this make it feel like you’re talking to me. 

I know your channel caters to the expensive and I can also say affordable. Yes I know there are some videos like that already posted, but this was a good episode thank you Nico. 

I will continue to grow and learn so that that way I can one day be able to buy a watch from you.

Also, I like when you’re loud, just keep researching sound deadening. Have one of your crewmembers go to another room to see if they can hear you.",Positive,0

"Was enjoying this video, and then it quickly ends with Nico saying saying the Casioak ""glitch"" thats on my wrist right now is nice, made my whole day lol.",Positive,0
"Agreed on Bulova's nonsense, most of their stuff is absolutely horrendous (their prices on their site too). I think they have a few gems though, like you said. Their vintage inspired ones like the automatic Hack/A11 can often be had for under $200 new (I paid $170 for the white dial version); and was my gateway to mechanical watches. 

When people want to move up a bit on the price scale, the Oceanographer and the Jet Star are pointing them (hopefully) back in the right direction when it comes to good watch design. The accuracy of the precisionist movement (+/- 5s/month) and the smooth sweep of the seconds hand on the Jet Star makes it a lot cooler than if it was regular quartz.",Positive,0
Just bought this swatch boreal few days ago as my first automatic watch. I couldn't really decide between swatch and Seiko but then I found it for sale (second hand but with no sings of usage) for ~125$. I had some doubts if it was a good decision and if Seiko wouldn't be better but now I'm sure I've made right call! Cheers!,Positive,0
"Best part of this video is when the neighbors arrived being confrontational and Nico says, ""First off, let me introduce myself.""

People don't know how to speak to people anymore.  Even if Nico is accidentally being a nuisance, you don't approach a stranger making demands.  That's the opposite of how to get what you want.",Positive,0

They have several different price points and many styles to pick from as well several price lines within the company. Having their own in house movements is also pretty impressive IMHO! How about it? Are they worth a look and if not, then why? Let’s get schtuckin!",Positive,0
